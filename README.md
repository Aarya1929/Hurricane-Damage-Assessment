The novel ensemble technique combines various techniques that are data augmentation, image processing, and transfer learning for the hybrid ensemble model for damage identification in satellite images.

The ensemble CNN model achieves an average accuracy of 93%, 90% precision, 99% recall, an AUC-ROC of 85%, and a balanced F1 score of 95%.
